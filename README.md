Welcome to the Malayalam IDE! This project is an innovative platform designed to allow programmers, learners, and enthusiasts to write and execute code entirely in Malayalam, making technology more inclusive and accessible to everyone who dreams of coding in their native language.

üõ†Ô∏è What is Malayalam IDE?
The Malayalam IDE is a fully functional Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports coding in Malayalam syntax. By combining the power of programming languages like Python with the beauty of the Malayalam script, this IDE aims to break the barriers of language and empower native speakers to write code intuitively.

Key features of the Malayalam IDE:

Code in Malayalam: Write and execute Python programs using Malayalam keywords, functions, and syntax.
Bilingual Output: Enables output in Malayalam, offering flexibility and inclusivity.
Beginner-Friendly: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it the perfect tool for beginners and students.
Comprehensive Conversion: Handles dynamic translation between Python and Malayalam seamlessly.

‚ú® Features
Full Malayalam Programming Support: Leverage Malayalam equivalents for Python keywords and functions like ‡¥Ö‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ï (print), ‡¥®‡¥ø‡µº‡¥µ‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ï (def), and more.
Dynamic Manglish Conversion: Convert Malayalam code into Manglish and vice versa with ease.
Syntax Highlighting and Debugging: Helps users write clean and error-free code with guided debugging.
Support for Malayalam Keywords and Functions: Includes translations for Python keywords, built-in functions, and error messages.
Built-in Compiler and Execution: Run your Malayalam code instantly and see real-time outputs in your language.

üéØ Why This Project?
Programming is often restricted to English, which can be a significant barrier for many native-language speakers. This project was born out of a passion for making programming accessible to Malayalam speakers. By integrating the richness of the Malayalam language into coding, this IDE aims to:

Empower students and professionals who are more comfortable with their native language.
Break linguistic barriers and inspire a new generation of programmers.
Preserve the beauty of the Malayalam script in the digital era.

üöÄ How It Works
Write Code in Malayalam: Use the IDE to write Python code with Malayalam syntax, keywords, and strings.
Translate & Execute: The IDE dynamically translates your Malayalam code into Python and executes it using a built-in Python interpreter.
Output in Malayalam or Manglish: View your output in either Malayalam script or Manglish, ensuring flexibility for users of all backgrounds.

üîë Key Highlights
Innovative Translation System: Dynamically converts between Malayalam, Python, and Manglish.
Interactive Learning: A perfect tool for teaching programming in schools and colleges in Kerala.
Inclusivity at Its Core: Reduces dependency on English for programming.
Educational Impact: A powerful medium to introduce programming to non-English speakers.

üéì Future Goals
Add support for more Indian languages.
Expand to support other programming languages.
Integrate AI for auto-correction and suggestion in Malayalam code.

üåç Impact
The Malayalam IDE is more than just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. By bridging the gap between technology and native languages, it creates opportunities for those who were previously excluded from the world of programming. It‚Äôs a step toward making technology truly global and inclusive.

üôè Acknowledgment of Limitations
While we've put great effort into building the Malayalam IDE, it‚Äôs still a growing project. If you encounter any bugs, inaccuracies in translations, or areas that could be improved, we‚Äôd love to hear from you. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us refine and enhance this tool.
